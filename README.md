# Trinity Industries - Train Car Repair Cycle Time Analysis

This notebook dives into a set of train car data. The goal is to better understand what drives repair cycle time and create a model to help predict it in order to improve fleet management efficiency and subsequent businesses that rely on it. It begins with initial thoughts on the data at first glance and goes into exploratory data analysis which includes checking for cleanliness of data and visualization. Following is feature engineering and statistically analysis, finishing up with a quick look at different machine learning algorithms to give an idea what direction the project should be taken in to best predict cycle time.
